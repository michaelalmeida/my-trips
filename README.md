# My portfolio now

My portfolio was outdated and I decided to change it for this my-trips small project. Instead of showing information about me (that you can find on my GitHub and Linkedin account), I want to share a part of my life that I really enjoy: travel!!

Quick information about the project:

-   React with Typescript;
-   Hygraph;
-   GraphQL (Apollo Client);
-   Leaflet for the maps;
-   Deploy with Vercel
